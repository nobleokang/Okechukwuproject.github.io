									<p>A seasoned HR professional with over eight years of experience at the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet), and a part-time Data Analyst role at 10analytics, I bring a unique combination of expertise in human resource management and data analytics. I hold an MBA in Human Resource Management and have extensive experience in talent management, employee engagement, compensation, and professional development.
										In my role at NiMet, I have been instrumental in developing and implementing welfare and compensation programs, driving recruitment strategies, and enhancing employee development initiatives that have resulted in a highly motivated and productive workforce. My leadership as the Branch President of the Senior Staff Association of Government Owned Companies and Statutory Corporations (SSASCGOC) has further strengthened my ability to advocate for and address the needs of employees while balancing organizational objectives.
										On the data analytics side, I specialize in using tools like Excel, Power BI, SQL, and Tableau to derive insights that drive strategic decision-making. My ability to transform data into actionable strategies has helped improve organizational processes, predict trends, and optimize performance.
										With a passion for both HR and data analysis, I am dedicated to creating a balanced approach that aligns employee well-being with organizational success. I thrive in dynamic environments that value data-driven solutions and am always eager to contribute to initiatives that foster growth and innovation.
