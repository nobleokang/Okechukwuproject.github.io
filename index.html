						<h2 class="major">Addressing Employee Attrition at Grace-Health: A Data-Driven Approach using
							tableau </h2>
						<p>Grace-Health's productivity has been significantly impacted by increasing employee attrition.
							To address this issue, it is crucial to analyze the available data to uncover the underlying
							factors driving attrition.
							As a Data Analyst, I utilize Tableau to monitor critical attrition KPIs. This tool has been
							invaluable in providing actionable insights that have guided the company in developing
							effective employee retention strategies, leading to a more engaged and stable workforce.
							The following key areas were analyzed:
							1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
							Total Number of Employees, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Active Employees, Average Age
							2. Attrition Analysis: Attrition by Department, Attrition by Gender
							3. Employee Demographics: Number of Employees by Age Bracket
							4. Attrition by Education Field
							5. Impact of Service Tenure:
							6. Travel Frequency: Percentage of Attrition by Travel Frequency
							7.Remuneration and Attrition:
							This data-driven approach has provided actionable insights, enabling Grace-Health to
							implement targeted interventions aimed at reducing attrition and enhancing overall
							organizational stability.
